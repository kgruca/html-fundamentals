        <h3>What is HTML?</h3>
        <p>
            All modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies: HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.  
        </p>
        <p>
            In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The opening tag</li>
            <li>The closing tag</li>
            <li>The actual element</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
